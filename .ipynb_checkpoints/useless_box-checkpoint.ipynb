    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The two servo motors `servo_lid` and `servo_switch` will each agitate levers that move the lid of the box and switch off the toggle switch, respectively.\n",
    "The two utilized servo motors each come with three wires:\n",
    "* `GND` (black/brown): Connect to the common ground `GND` of the box (see the section above).\n",
    "* `PWM`(yellow/orange): Connect to two digital `PWM` pins of the Arduino (here `D9` and `D10`).\n",
    "* `5V` (red): Connect to two of the 5 V outputs of the rechargeable battery.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: The servo motors cannot be powered off the 5 V pin of the Arduino board due to the limited current it provides. Here the 5 V outputs of a rechargeable LiPo battery have been used. Alternatively you can also power the servo motors with four AA batteries in series, adding up to 6 V in total.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Connect one pin of the toggle switch to the common ground `GND` and the other one to a digital pin on the Arduino board (here: `D2`).\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now connect the Arduino Nano board to your computer via USB and open the `useless_box.ino` sketch in the Arduino IDE.\n",
    "Eventually adapt the pin numbers for the toggle switch (`switch_pin`, here: `D2`), the servo moving the box lid (`servo_lid_pin`, here: `D10`), and the servo moving the toggle switch (`servo_switch_pin`, here: `D9`).\n",
    "Then upload the modified sketch to the Arduino Nano board to program the microcontroller.\n",
    "You should now be able to trigger the two servos by toggling the toggle switch.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the levers are mounted to the servos.\n",
    "Therefore trigger a closing animation by toggling the switch and once the animation is done, unplug the USB cable, such that the servos remain in their rest position.\n",
    "Glue the small plastic levers that come with the servo motors into foreseen perforations of the 3D-printed levers.\n",
    "Then attach the levers to the servos:\n",
    "Make sure that the lever of the lid servo is oriented horizontally, pointing towards the front of the box, when resting.\n",
    "The switch servo lever should be oriented vertically, pointing towards the bottom of the box, when resting.\n",
    "If you now power on the Arduino board via USB and trigger a animation by toggling the switch, the levers should open the box, untoggle the switch and close the box again.\n",
    "If not, then you'd need to adjust the lever position.\n",
    "If you are happy with the design, screw the levers onto the servo motors through the foreseen perforations, using the tiny screws that come with the servos.\n",

    "The perforation above the cutout for the Arduino Nano on the breadboard holds the three-state power switch.\n",
    "Depending on whether the switch is locked in its leftmost, center, or rightmost position, it will connect the single pins with the two leftmost, center, or rightmost pins, respectively.\n",
    "Connect the left pin of the left array to the common ground `GND`.\n",
    "Remove the servo ground connections and connect them to the single pin corresponding to the left array instead. You can now turn the servo motor power supply on and off - simulataneously for both motors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally it would be super neat, if one could also power the Arduino Nano board with the rechargeable battery.\n",
    "Therefore connect the only yet unconnected 5 V output of the battery pack to the leftmost pin of the onoccupied right array of the three-state switch. The corresponding single pin of the right array needs to be connected to the `5V` pin of the Arduino Nano board. The same power switch can now simultaneously turn off and on the power supply for both servos and the microcontroller board.\n",
    "WARNING: Don't switch the box on and connect the Arduino Nano to a computer via USB at the same time; you might irreversibly damage the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Under `jfk` in the `useless_box.ino` sketch you can now add your own animations.\n",
    "If you also have a plushy to spare, cut off its head and arm to give the box a nice appearance.\n",
